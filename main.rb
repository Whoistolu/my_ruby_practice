Creating a Method
You can create your own custom methods in Ruby using the following syntax:

def my_name
  "Joe Smith"
end

puts my_name    #=> "Joe Smith"
Letâ€™s break this example down:

def is a built-in keyword that tells Ruby that this is the start of a method definition.
my_name is the name of your new method. You can name your methods almost anything you want, but there are some constraints and conventions, which are described in the next section.
"Joe Smith" is the code inside the method body. All of the logic for your method is contained in the indented lines of the method body. This particular method returns a string when the method is called.
end is a built-in keyword that tells Ruby that this is the end of the method definition.
To call the method, you simply need to use its name, as shown in the last line of the example.
